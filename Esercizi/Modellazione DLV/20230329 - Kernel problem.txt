% Kernel problem

% Given a directed graph G=<V,A> does there exists as
% subset V' of V such that no two vertices are joined
% by an arc in A and such that for every vertex v in 
% V-V' there is a vertex u in V' for which an arc
% between u and v is in A.

% V {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
% V'{1, 4, 7, 9}

% Guess
inKernel(X) | outKernel(X) :- node(X).
connected(X) :- inKernel(Y), arc(Y,X).

% Check
:- inKernel(X), inKernel(Y), arc(Y,X).
:- outKernel(X), not connected(X).
